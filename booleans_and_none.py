# Booleans

# True or False
# Make sure to capitalise True and False
# a = True
# b = False
# use comparison operators
# print(a == b) # False
# print(a != b) # True
# print(a >= b) # True is greater than false
# print(a >= True) # True, because a is equal to True
# print(b <= False) # True, b is = to False or b is lass than a

# print(True and False) # False, True and True will return True everything else will return False
# print(False and True) # False
# print(False or True) # True, because of or True is available

# Booleans are useful for quickly checking he state of something, and making a decision based on that state.
# The other area Booleans are really useful for are validating data types

# Booleans with data types

# hi = "Hello world!"
#
# print(hi.isalpha()) # False
# isalpha checks if everything is alphanumeric

# print(hi.islower()) # False
# islower checks if everything is lowercase
# print(hi.isupper()) # False
# isupper checks if everything is uppercase
# print(hi.endswith("!")) # True
# Check what string ends with
# print(hi.startswith("Hello")) # True
# # Check what string starts with, Case sensitive

# x = 0
# y = 10
# z = -15
# print(bool(x)) # 0 is considered always False
#
# print(bool(y)) # True positive numbers is true
#
# print(bool(z)) # True, minus numbers are also true

# None

# None == Null in a lot of other languages

# print(bool(None)) # False, None is always False

# x = None

# print(x == False) # False,
# print(x == True) # False,

# None, True and False are independent None != True or False

# Checking if a variable is None

# print(x == None) # direct comparison - this can be a problem in more complex situations

# print(x is None) # Best practice for checking is something 'is None

# print(type(x)) # <class 'NoneType'>
